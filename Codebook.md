# Codebook for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project

## Original data set

The data set to be analyzed and processed in this project was collected and provided by The Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE) of the University of Genoa.

A series of experiments has been carried out by DIBE to collect various movement related data. The electric signals was generated by smartphones attached to the participants' waists while performing light exercise activities.

For detailed information regarding the original data please refer to one or all of the below sources:
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The original data set also includes a README file which provides more information regarding the processed data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The data was devided into two separate data sets; a training and a test data set.
Both data sets use the same variables. The data made available for the public contains the raw signal recordings along with a set of calculated values stored in spearate files.

For this particular project only a subset of the calculated values - related to either the mean or the standard deviation of the observations - was used. To make these variable names more readable a few minor modifications had to be performed without rendering them unrecognizable.
